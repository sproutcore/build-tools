    Define this property if you need one or more proxies.
    If you do a request from your app (file or XHR) which doesn't match anything the BT provide,
    the request will be run past the proxies in the order you define them here.
    You can use the prefix to filter which requests will be forwarded to where.
    In the proxied request the prefix you define will be replaced by the proxyPrefix.
    The example shows how to set up a catch-all proxy, in this case to CouchDB.
    You can set as many proxies as you want, as long as they don't share a prefix.

    Example:

        proxies: [
          {
            prefix: '/',   // set a prefix here for the development server
            host: 'localhost', // to which host should the request be forwarded
            port: 5984, // on which port is the host listening?
            logRequests: false, // show the requests in the terminal?
            proxyPrefix: '/' // replace the prefix set above with this
          }
        ]

    @property
    @type Array
    @default null
  */
  proxies: null
